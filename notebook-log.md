Savannah elephants, Loxodonta africana, were debated to be a different species than forest elephants, Loxodonta cyclotis. This paper sequenced mitochondrial DNA from each species and found diverging molecular clades. 
Two sets of samples were taken: hair/blood from 26 wild-born elephants and bone/tooth from another 23 specimens, representing both central and western Africa. 
About 3700 bp fragments along the cytochrome b gene, the control region, 12S rRNA gene, and three tRNAs were studied.
