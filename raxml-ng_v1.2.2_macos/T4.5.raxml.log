./raxml-ng --bsconverge --bs-trees T4.raxml.bootstraps --prefix T4.5 --seed 123 --threads 2 --bs-cutoff 0.01

Analysis options:
  run mode: A posteriori bootstrap convergence test
  start tree(s): 
  random seed: 123
  SIMD kernels: SSE3
  parallelization: coarse-grained (auto), PTHREADS (2 threads), thread pinning: OFF

Reading bootstrap trees from file: T4.raxml.bootstraps
Loaded 200 trees with 48 taxa.

Performing bootstrap convergence assessment using autoMRE criterion
