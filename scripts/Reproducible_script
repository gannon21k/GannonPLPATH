Savannah elephants, Loxodonta africana, were debated to be a different species than forest elephants, Loxodonta cyclotis. This paper sequenced mitochondrial DNA from each species and found diverging molecular clades. 
Two sets of samples were taken: hair/blood from 26 wild-born elephants and bone/tooth from another 23 specimens, representing both central and western Africa. 
About 3700 bp fragments along the cytochrome b gene, the control region, 12S rRNA gene, and three tRNAs were studied.

Before alignment, I compiled all of the raw data files from this research article into one fasta file: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2004.00044.x 

I convert each sequence into single lined with the names of each taxa with this command
sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n\([^>]\)/\1/g' gannon_elephant.fasta > gannon_elephant_single_lineNAMED

I will choose to use MUSCLE because it is overall the best sequencer between itself, ClustalW, and TeaCoffee. A limitation it has is that it doesn't do well with high diversity data, which I don't have. My data should be pretty similar. Another shining quality is that it has improved progressive alignment and has a large size capability. Because of these factors, I will choose MUSCLE.

Maximum likelihood:

RAxML-ng 

Software:
RAxML is a widely used software for phylogenetic tree inference using the Maximum Likelihood method. It is designed to efficiently analyze large datasets and supports various models of nucleotide and protein evolution.

Description:
RAxML implements the ML method for inferring phylogenies from sequence data. It supports partitioned models, bootstrapping, and different types of substitution models. The software is optimized for high-performance computing and parallel processing.

Strengths:

Fast and scalable for large datasets.
Optimized for multi-threading and distributed computing.
Supports various substitution models and partitioning strategies.
Well-documented and widely used in evolutionary biology.
Offers bootstrapping for tree support assessment.

Weaknesses:

Can be computationally expensive for very large datasets.
Requires careful model selection to avoid bias.
Limited support for mixed-model analyses compared to Bayesian approaches.
May not handle highly recombining sequences well.

Assumptions:

The mutation process is the same at every branch of the tree
We assume sites evolve independently
All sites evolve the same 
The phylogenetic tree follows a bifurcating structure.

I followed this tutorial to download and run RAxML: https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/exercises/notebook-log.md

MrBayes

Description: 

A program for Bayesian inference of phylogeny using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. It estimates the posterior probability of phylogenetic trees and model parameters.

Strengths:

- Provides probability-based estimates of trees
- Can incorporate complex evolutionary models
- Supports mixed-model analysis
- Well-documented and widely used

Weaknesses:

- Computationally intensive
- Convergence can be hard to assess
- Slower than some alternatives for large datasets

Assumptions:

- Assumes a model of sequence evolution
- Assumes priors for parameters and tree topology
- MCMC sampling reflects the posterior distribution

Downloading MrBayes: 

% brew tap brewsci/bio
% brew install mrbayes --with-open-mpi

I create the MrBayes block in accordance with the research paper's data (the researchers did not use bayesian methods so all priors and such are derived from the data)

% touch mbblock2.txt
% open mbblock2.txt

begin mrbayes;
 set autoclose=yes;
